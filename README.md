# Homework Assignment 2 — Rocket Ship

This assignment focuses on for loops and using a class constant.

Complete the program named **RocketShip.java** so that it produces the output shown below.

Starter code will be provided in the GitHub Classroom repository.

---

## Requirements

- Complete **RocketShip.java**
- Do not change any code in `main`
- You may add any code you like to the other methods
- You may add additional helper methods to reduce redundancy
- Use a class constant (for example: `public static final int ROCKET_SIZE = 3;`)
  so it is possible to change the size of the rocket
- To receive full credit, you must have multiple, progressive commits with descriptive messages.

## Notes

1. Include a comment header at the top of your file in the following form:

       // Your Name Here
       // CPW 140
       // Assignment #2
       //
       // This program will ... (describe what the program does)

2. There should only be one class, named `RocketShip`. Use the exististing file made for you in the repository root.

3. Apply techniques from lecture and Chapter 2 to use nested loops and the class constant so the code works for rocket sizes 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

4. Comments should appear in the methods of `RocketShip` to explain what you are doing and why you are doing it (you do not need to comment `main`).
